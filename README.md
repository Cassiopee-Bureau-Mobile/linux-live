# Secure Linux Live Kit

Use this set of scripts to turn your existing preinstalled Linux
distribution into a Live Kit (formely known as Live CD) on an USB stick.
Make sure to extract and use it on a posix-compatible filesystem,
since it creates some (sym)links and such.

This version create a Live Linux on a USB stick with a crypted home directory. It allows you to keep your data in /home totally safe (mozilla shortcuts, personals folder...).

Combined with a personnal VPN (like self-hosted OpenVPN), you can have a totally secure and anonymous Linux OS.

# How it works

The Live Kit is a set of scripts that will create a Live Linux from your existing Linux installation. It will create a squashfs image of your system.

First the Live Kit will format your USB stick with 3 partitions:

- A boot partition (FAT32)
- A root partition (ext4)
- A home partition (ext4)

Then, the home partition is encrypted with LUKS, and the /home directory is copied to it.

The image builed is copied to the USB stick and the bootfiles for the EFI will be configured.
**Now the USB stick is ready to boot !**

At the boot, the home partition is decrypted using crypttab. Then, the home partition is mounted in /home with a crontab.

If the boot option is not in mode persistent, all changes made outside the /home/user directory will be lost at the reboot. This includes the installation of new software, the modification of the /etc directory, the modification of the /usr directory...

If the Live OS is in persistent mode, all changes made outside the /home/user directory will be saved at the reboot. _However, this act like a "copy-on-write" system. If you modify a file in /etc for exemple and if you restart your Live OS in Live mode, you will have the original file. If you restart your Live OS in persistent mode, you will have the modified file._

# How to create a Live Linux

## The build

- First of all **set up your Custom Linux**. To do so, I use a VM on Virtual Box to set up all the files and software you want to have on your linux. _You have a full installation guid for Debian [here](/DOC/Full_Debian_Installation.md)_

- Once you have your custom linux set up, you need to **create a Live Kit** from it. To do so, download the Linux Live Kit from this repo. You may not want to include the repo in your futur Live linux, so I recommend you to put it in a directory such as /a. _(Be warned, if you put it to /tmp, some distros may erase it on reboot.)_

_You can create a directory /a and put the Live Kit in it with the following commands :_

    sudo mkdir /a

    sudo wget https://github.com/Cassiopee-Bureau-Mobile/linux-live/archive/refs/heads/master.zip -P /a

    sudo unzip /a/master.zip -d /a

- Before you start building your Kit, edit the file ./config. Most importantly change the LIVEKITNAME variable and the size of your wanted home dir (edit HOME_SIZE in config).

- If you want to enable persistente changes in your Live linux system (like adding new, software, or editing other files than thoses in your home directory), you need to set the PERSISTENT variable to 1.

- Make sure your kernel is in /vmlinuz or change the path in ./config. Your kernel must support squashfs. Your kernel must also support either aufs or overlayfs or both. AUFS is recommended for more flexibility, but if your distro does not support it, overlayfs will work too.

- Linux Live Kit comes with precompiled static binaries in ./initramfs directory. Those may be outdated but will work. You may replace them by your own statically linked binaries, if you know how to compile them.

- If you have tmpfs mounted on /tmp during building your Live Kit ISO, make sure you have enough RAM since LiveKit will store lots of data in /tmp. If you are low on RAM, make sure /tmp is a regular on-disk directory.

- When done connect the USB key to your VM. Run the ./build script to create your Live Secure USB stick

```
sudo /a/linux-live-master/build.sh /dev/sdX
```

_Tip: To find out the device of your USB key, you can use the command `sudo fdisk -l`._

- Once the build is complete (approximately 30 minutes), the USB key is ready. Safely remove it and boot a machine from it.

<h2>You can now start on your USB stick !</h2>

Notes:

- In the syslinux boot interface, you can customize the syslinux.cfg to have the choice between Persistent mode or Live mode. if you execute the classic Linux, you will have the exact linux you've build. You can have persistent changes using the right option, but this will never change the original Live linux you've build. _So be aware that your persistent changes will only be available with the Persistent changes mode in the boot interface._
- You can edit persistent mode by changing sur syslinux.cfg file, refers to the two syslinux configuration files in the utils directory in this repo.
- You can have more Live mode editing the syslinux.cfg. The option `perch` is the option to have persistent changes. The option `toram` is the option to have a Live mode in RAM (make sure you have enough RAM to run your Live OS directly from the RAM).

## Other Configurations

During the build process, an error may occur _(like if the USB is disconnected during the execution)_.

In such cases, if your build is already done and there is a file named linux-data-3699 in your tmp folder, you don't need to rebuild. Instead, execute the following command directly:

```
sudo /a/linux-live-master/utils/install_without_build.sh /dev/sdX LIVEKITDATA LIVEKITNAME
```
