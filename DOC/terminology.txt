Live Kit
--------

* also known as Linux Live Kit. Formely known as Linux Live CD. Nowadays,
people mostly use USB flash drives, cameras, and other devices to run
such 'Live' linuxes, thus Live CD is no longer ideal name for it.

Meaning of Kit is like a tool, toolkit, or such. Which (I believe) corresponds
with the usage of such Live Linux distribution much better.

This Live kit, allows you to create a secure Live Linux Custom OS.
