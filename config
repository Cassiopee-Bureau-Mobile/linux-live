# This is a config file for Linux Live Kit build script.
# You shouldn't need to change anything expect LIVEKITNAME

# Live Kit Name. Defaults to 'linux';
# This will be the name of the directory created on your CD/USB, which
# will contain everything including boot files and such.
# For example, Slax changes it to 'slax'
# Must not contain any spaces.
# If you change it, you must run ./tools/isolinux.bin.update script
# in order to update isolinux.bin for CD booting.
# If you do not need booting from CD (eg you're booting only from USB)
# then you can ignore recompiling isolinux.bin, just rename LIVEKITNAME
# and you're done.

# Choose the size of your /home directory that will be encrypted
HOME_SIZE="5000" # in MiB

# Active persistence mode. Set to 1 to enable.
# If enabled, you will be able to save changes to your Live Kit system files (every files except those in /home).
# Becareful, the /home encrypted directory is always persistent. Use this option only if you want to save changes in the system files.

# Kernel file, will be copied to your Live Kit
# Your kernel must support aufs and squashfs. Debian Jessie's kernel is ready
# out of the box.

# Live Kit with a different kernel than the one you are actually running

# No subdirectories are allowed, no slashes,
# so You can't use /var/tmp here for example
# Exclude directories like proc sys tmp

# If you require network support in initrd, for example to boot over
# PXE or to load data using 'from' boot parameter from a http server,
# you will need network modules included in your initrd.
# This is disabled by default since most people won't need it.
# To enable, set to true
